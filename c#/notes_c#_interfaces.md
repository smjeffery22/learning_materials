# C# Interfaces

- Interfaces allow codes to be flexible and easy to maintain and test

- Interface can be think of as a *contract*
  - When a class implements an interface, it fulfills that contract by carrying over functions from the interface

- Interfaces only contain declarations, not implementation codes
  - Allows to be more flexible

- Members of interfaces do not have access modifiers (public, private, etc.)
  - Public by default
  - Classes and abstracts' default are private

- Program to an *interface* rather than a regular *class* depending on situations
  - Higher level functionality
